# Age Estimation with Computer Vision – Good Seed  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project helps the Good Seed supermarket chain **verify customer age from photos** to comply with regulations and prevent alcohol sales to minors.  

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** was developed and trained on thousands of face images to estimate people’s ages.  

## 🎯 Results  
- The model achieved **MAE ~10.13 years**.  
- Generalized well across different age groups and image conditions.  
- Provides support for automated age verification at point of sale.  

## 🛠️ Technologies  
GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dense, Dropout, ImageDataGenerator, MobileNetV2, preprocess_input  
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, CNN, ResNet50, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.  

## 📊 Business Impact  
The solution allows Good Seed to:  
- **Comply with legal regulations** for alcohol sales.  
- **Reduce human errors** in age verification.  
- **Improve safety and trust** in the sales process.
